// // Basic pattern making rules (applicable for all patterns)

// Rule no1 : all the patterns consists of nested loops .
// Rule no2: mostly 2 loops :1 inner loops , 2 outer loops.
// Rule no3: for outer loop, count the number of lines(i.e rows)
// Rule no4: for inner loop ,focus on the columns and connect them with the rows.
// Rule no5: always print the "*" inside the inner loop(mostly).
// Rule no6: observe symmetry in certain pattern(optional).
